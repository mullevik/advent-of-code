### 04
Using `hyperfine` command to perf values

Parallelization works but the runtime of aoc input was so fast that it did not make any difference.

I was only able to use `par_iter_mut` with `for_each` stuff...

Once it is written functionally - the paralellization can not be made easier actually.

### 05
Implementing custom `Iterator` to mimic python's yield syntax.

This seems to be very logical in Rust but the syntax is not as clear as in python.
