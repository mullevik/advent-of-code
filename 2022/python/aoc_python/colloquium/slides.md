### Advent of code

---

- series of `25` daily challenges

- each has 2 parts

- programming language independent

- **Python**, JS (TS), Rust, (Excel)

- difficulty increases with each task *

### Graph theory basics

---

Mathematical graph (aka Network):

$$ G = (V, E) $$
$$ V = \{1, ..., n\} $$

with undirected edges

$$ E = \{\{x, y\} \mid x,y \in V \land x \not = y \} $$

with directed edges

$$ E = \{(x, y) \mid x,y \in V \land x \not = y \} $$

A path

$$ P = (v_1, v_2, ..., v_n) $$

$$ v_i \in V $$

$$ (v_i, v_{i+1}) \in E $$

$$ i \neq j \mid \forall i,j \in \{1, ..., n\}   $$

$$ |P| := n - 1 $$

---

How do you find it?

---

#### Depth-first search

---

#### Depth-first search
Is it sound?

---

Is it sound?
- each vertex is visited at most once
- the whole reachable part of the graph will be visited

---

Is it fast?

---

### _Asymptotic complexity_

![[complexity.png]]

---


$$ f(n) \in \mathcal{O}(g(n)) $$

$$ \exists c \in \mathbb{R}, \exists n_0 \in \mathbb{N}: $$

$$\forall n \in \mathbb{N}: n > n_0: c \cdot f(n) \le g(n) $$


---

- $$ \mathcal{O}(n): $$ read a book
- $$ \mathcal{O}(n!): $$ shuffle a deck of cards into all possible variations  
- $$ \mathcal{O}(\log n): $$ find a word in a dictionary
- $$ \mathcal{O}(1): $$ what's your name?

---

#### Depth-first search
Is it fast?

---

#### Depth-first search

Worst case complexity

$$ \mathcal{O}(|V| + |E|) $$

Every vertex and every edge may be visited

---

#### Breadth-first search

	2 -- 8 --> 3

```

#### Dijkstra's algorithm

---

#### Dijkstra's algorithm

Worst case complexity

$$ \mathcal{O}(|E| \cdot T_{dk} + |V| \cdot T_{em}) $$

Using binary heap

$$ \mathcal{O}((|E| + |V|) \log |V|) $$

---

What about larger graphs?

---

Planning
- state space + expanding function
- initial state
- one or more goal states
---

Search in a state space

---

Can we go faster?

---

#### Heuristic algorithms

---

True weight

$$ w: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $$

Heuristic estimate

$$ h: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $$

---

Goal-awareness

$$ h(v_g) = 0 $$

Consistency

$$ h(v_g) = 0 $$

$$ h(v_s) \le w((v_p, v_s)) + h(v_p) $$

---

Admissibility

$$ h(v) \le g_{true}(v) \mid \forall v \in V $$

$$ g_{true}(v) := $$ the true length of the shortest path 

from $$v$$ to goal

---

#### A Star

$$ f_{score} = g_{score}(v) + h(v) $$

$$ g_{score}(v) := $$ length of the shortest path 

from start to $$v$$ so far

---

A Star finds optimal path $$ \leftrightarrow $$ heuristic is admissible

### What made me faster?

---
1. write trivial tests first

```python
def test_parse() -> None:
	points = list(parse(load_stripped_lines("inputs/18_0")))
	assert len(points) == 13
	assert points[0] == Point3(2, 2, 2)
	assert points[-1] == Point3(2, 3, 5)
```

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
	test_parse()
	assert solve_first("inputs/18_0") == 64
	assert solve_second("inputs/18_0") == 58
	print(solve_second("inputs/18_1"))
```

---
<!-- slide style="font-size: 0.7em" -->

2. top-down approach is faster

```python
def shortest_path(start: Point2, goal: Point2, grid: Grid2) -> list[Point2]:
	...
```

---

3. writing code is fast, debugging is slow

- mypy
- black
- pytest

---

4. start by solving the task on paper

---

5. do not repeat yourself
