# Python solutions for AOC 2022

These are my solutions to the infamous [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) challenge.

The following are python-related implementation notes for each task.

## Day 1

Splitting iterable into multiple iterables.

I consider my solution to be garbage.

## Day 2

Python >3.10 match statement for Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

I consider my solution to be garbage.

## Day 3

Set operations.

I consider my solution to be solid.

## Day 4

Just iteration, not much about it.

I consider my solution to be solid.

## Day 5

Tedious parsing into multiple LIFO stacks.
Nice animation.

I consider my solution to be bad.

## Day 6

String indexing, not much about it.

I consider my solution to be ok.

## Day 7

Parsing of file-system commands.
Context-free parsing (probably could be parsed as a regular lang. as well). 
Tree hierarchy. 
Actually could be solved nicely with `Path` module.

I consider my solution to be ok.

It took me 1:20:00.

## Day 8

Casting rays in 2D grid.

I consider my solution to be solid.

It took me 1:07:00.

## Day 9

Simulating chain with iterative rules.
Nice animation.

I consider my solution to be ok.

It took me 1:50:00.

## Day 10

Simulating CRT screen sprite drawing.
Simple iteration, not much about it.
Nice animation.

I consider my solution to be meh.

It took me 0:49:20.

## Day 11

Very tedious parsing of monkey information.
Simple simulation iteration with interesting discrete math optimization for part two.

I consider my solution to be good.

It took me 1:20:29

## Day 12

Very tipical BFS algorithm task.
Second part needs to reverse the BFS from sink.

I consider my solution to be good.

It took me 0:55:00

## Day 13

Very precise decision making (I hated that part) plus a sorting algorithm.
I decided to implement my merge sort just to because.

I consider my solution to be bad.

It took me 2:25:00 (that first part was awful).

## Day 14

Falling sand simulation.
Simple while looping.
Nice animation.

I consider my solution to be good.

It took me 0:49:25.

## Day 15

Intersections of rotated squares in 2D space.
Line to point intersection and line to line intersection.
Manhattan distance.

I consider my solution to be ok.

It took me 2:05:00.

## Day 16

Search of a big search space.
Solved by pruning most of the paths by filtering out impossible branches.

I consider my solution to be awful. The second part took multiple hours to compute the correct solution.

It took me 5:00:00.

## Day 17

Tetris simulation for part one.
Periodic detection and linear model prediction for part two.

I consider my solution to be fine.

It took me 2:45:00.


## Day 18

DFS in a 3D grid.
Nothing strange about it.

I consider my solution to be good (with hardcoded bounds though).

It took me 0:45:00.


## Day 19

Skipped for now as it looks like a very difficult task - perhaps the most difficult one.


## Day 20

Very easy indexing and inserting/removing within a list of numbers.

I consider my solution to be mediocre.

It took me 0:35:00.

## Day 21

Very interesting task.
Math equation construction from a tree of simple operations.
Part one was satisfying and it took me 18 minutes.
Part two is a general solver for equations containing four basic arithmetic operations,
which was actually more difficult then I anticipated.

I consider my solution to contain too many special-case handlers.

It took me 2:15:00.

## Day 22

Navigating a UV map of a cube.
My solution has hardcoded edge warping.

I consider my solution to be ok but not very general.

It took me 3:30:00.

# Day 23

Very straight forward simulation that did not have any interesting twist...

I consider my solution to be quite ugly because the first try solved the task.

It took me 0:45:00.
